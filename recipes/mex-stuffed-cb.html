    <h2>Description</h2>
    Air fried chicken breast stuffed with vegetables and spices.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 extra long toothpicks</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons chili powder, divided</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons ground cumin, divided</li>
        <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chipotle flakes</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 fresh jalapeno pepper, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons corn oil</li>
        <li>1/2 lime, juiced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place toothpicks in a small bowl and cover with water; let them soak to keep them from burning while cooking.</li>
        <li>Mix 2 teaspoons chili powder and 2 teaspoons cumin in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breast on a flat work surface. Slice horizontally through the middle. Pound each half using a kitchen mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each breast half equally with remaining chili powder, remaining cumin, chipotle flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Place 1/2 the bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno in the center of 1 breast half. Roll the chicken from the tapered end upward and use 2 toothpicks to secure. Repeat with other breast, spices, and vegetables and secure with remaining toothpicks. Roll each roll-up in the chili-cumin mixture in the shallow dish while drizzling with olive oil until evenly covered.</li>
        <li>Place roll-ups in the air-fryer basket with the toothpick side facing up. Set timer for 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn roll-ups over. Continue cooking in the air fryer until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Drizzle lime juice evenly on roll-ups before serving.</li> 
    </ol>
